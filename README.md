## About Me

I help create more value for businesses and individuals with my skills in a wide range of programming utilities and languages and my knowledge of back-end and front-end development requirements.

I do this by developing and maintaining web applications as well as teaching people how to do so for themselves.

I spoke at a student conference organized by Microsoft Student Partners in South Africa during the lockdown of 2020. Currently, I am a FullStack JS Instructor at GoMyCode Nigeria.
